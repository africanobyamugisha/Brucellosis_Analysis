# Brucellosis Prevalence Analysis 🐄🐐🐑

Welcome to the Brucellosis Prevalence Analysis repository! This analysis provides valuable insights into the prevalence of Brucellosis in different livestock species, including Bovine 🐄, Caprine 🐐, and Ovine 🐑, in various districts 🏘️. We utilize a set of powerful data analysis tools and packages to explore the distribution of this disease, uncover variations among species and districts, and unveil correlations between their prevalence.

## Methodology 📊📈

Here's a peek into the methodology and the tools we've harnessed for this analysis:

1. **Data Preparation 📋**:
   - We start by loading and tidying the data using the `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `readr`, and `janitor` packages to ensure it's in a pristine format for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization 📊📉**:
   - We employ the versatile `ggplot2` package to craft an array of captivating data visualizations. These visual aids help us grasp the prevalence of Brucellosis in different livestock species and districts.

3. **Statistical Wizardry 🧙‍♂️**:
   - Our statistical analysis relies on the trusty `Hmisc` package. It aids us in conducting correlation tests, unveiling the intricate relationships between species' prevalence rates.

4. **Interactive Magic 🪄✨**:
   - To keep things dynamic and engaging, we've conjured up interactive charts and tables using packages such as `kableExtra`, `DT`, and `highcharter`.

5. **Report Crafting 📄🖋️**:
   - The `rmarkdown` package is our parchment and quill, helping us create rich reports that seamlessly blend code, stunning visualizations, and eloquent narratives to tell the story of Brucellosis prevalence.

6. **Tabular Elegance 🧐📊**:
   - We've partnered with the `gtsummary` package to craft beautifully formatted tables, making it a breeze to present detailed data summaries with pizzazz.
